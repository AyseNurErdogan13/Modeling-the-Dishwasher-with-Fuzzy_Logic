# Modeling the Dishwasher with Fuzzy Logic
 In this project, a fuzzy logic modeling of a dishwasher was developed using several input parameters (e.g. the degree of soiling of dishes, type of dishes, amount of detergent, etc.) and an output parameter (e.g. washing time, water temperature, etc.). The fuzzy logic approach models many complex and uncertain relationships of a dishwasher based on its input parameters.
